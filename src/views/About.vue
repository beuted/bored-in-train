        I started this dumb Idle game because I was bored on the train. I drop it right after (like most of my personnal projects âš°).
        Started it over and moved it to vuejs because I wanted to learn, eventually I got a nice idea: What if I was trying to make an idle game
        with a bit of <i>pathos</i> in it ? Anyway I learned a bit doing it and had some fun myself. I hope you'll like it.
