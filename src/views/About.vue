        I started this dumb Idle game because I was bored on the train. I drop it right after (like most of my personnal projects âš°).
        Started it over and moved it to vuejs because I wanted to learn, eventually I an idea: What if I made an idle game
        where you can loose ? Anyway I learned some stuff doing it and had some fun myself. I hope you'll like it.
